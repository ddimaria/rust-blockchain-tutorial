# WASM Runtime

The [runtime](runtime) crate is a wasmtime runtime for executing WASM contracts.
It leverages the [component model](https://github.com/WebAssembly/component-model) and [wit-bindgen](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wit-bindgen) to simplify host and guest interactions.

## Development

Before running tests, you'll need to compile any contracts in the `/contracts` folder.
